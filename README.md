A Library Management System built with Tkinter (Python) and JSON, featuring an interactive GUI, fully capable of:

+ Adding new books: Register books with unique IDs, names, and fields, marked as "Available" by default.
+ Searching books: Find books by ID or name (case-insensitive), displaying details or matching results.
+ Deleting books: Remove books by ID, name, or both, with input validation.
+ Displaying all books: List all books with names and IDs in a separate window.
+ Borrowing books: Assign books to students with a 7-day due date, updating status to "Borrowed."
+ Returning books: Process book returns, logging return dates and marking books as "Available."
+ Displaying borrowed/returned books: View borrowed books with student IDs and due dates, or returned books with return dates.
+ Managing seats: Add seat rows, find empty seats, occupy, or clear seats, with availability tracking.
+ Adding students: Register students with IDs and names.
+ Displaying all students: List all registered students with IDs and names.
+ Persistent storage: Save all data (books, borrowing, seats, students) to JSON files for retention across sessions.
+ Error handling: Validate inputs and provide user feedback via message boxes for success, warnings, or errors.
